## Why versu?

<!--<div class="vp-doc">-->

### The Problem

Managing versions in multi-module projects is painful:

- **Manual versioning is error-prone** — Developers forget to bump versions or choose the wrong increment
- **Dependencies are a nightmare** — When module A changes, which dependents need bumping?
- **Inconsistent practices** — Different team members have different versioning philosophies
- **Changelog chaos** — Manually maintained changelogs become outdated or incomplete
- **CI/CD complexity** — Building robust versioning automation from scratch is time-consuming

### The Solution

Versu automates the entire versioning lifecycle:

- **Zero manual decisions** — Your commit messages dictate version bumps automatically
- **Smart dependency tracking** — When a module changes, Versu automatically identifies and versions all dependents
- **Team consistency** — Everyone follows the same Conventional Commits standard
- **Generated changelogs** — Beautiful, accurate changelogs generated per-module from commit history
- **Pre-release support** — Seamlessly generate alpha, beta, rc, or custom pre-release versions
- **Ecosystem agnostic** — Works with Gradle, npm, Maven, or any ecosystem through custom plugins
